    "#Ans:-The open function is used to open a file in Python. The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.'r' (read-only mode): This is the default mode in which a file is opened. In this mode, the file is opened in read-only mode and any attempt to write to the file will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.'w' (write mode): In this mode, the file is opened in write mode and any existing data in the file will be truncated (deleted). If the file does not exist, a new file with the given name is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.'a' (append mode): In this mode, the file is opened in append mode and data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file with the given name is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.'x' (exclusive creation mode): In this mode, the file is opened in write mode and a new file is created. If the file already exists, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.'b' (binary mode): This mode is used to open a binary file such as an image or a video file. The file is opened in binary mode and any data written to the file is in binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.'t' (text mode): This mode is used to open a text file. The file is opened in text mode and any data written to the file is in text format. This is the default mode for opening text files."

    "#Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The close function is used to close a file in Python after it has been opened. It is important to close a file because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources to that file. If the file is not closed, these resources will not be freed, which can lead to a shortage of resources and slow down the system. Closing the file frees up these resources and makes them available for other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring data integrity: When a file is opened for writing, any data written to the file is stored in a buffer in the operating system. The data is not written to the actual file on the disk until the file is closed or the buffer is flushed. If the file is not closed, the data may not be written to the disk, leading to data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding file corruption: If a file is not closed properly, it can become corrupted, leading to errors when attempting to read the file. Closing the file ensures that the file is properly closed and any data written to the file is committed to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, it is important to always close a file after it has been opened. In Python, you can use the with statement to automatically close a file when it is no longer needed. This ensures that the file is closed even if an exception occur"
