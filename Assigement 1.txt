Assignment Questions

1. Who developed Python Programming Language?
Ans:Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum.Python programming language was first released in 1991.

2. Which type of Programming does Python support?
Ans:Python supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, procedural, functional, and aspect-oriented 
programming styles. It is commonly used for general-purpose programming tasks, such as web development, scientific computing,
data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?
Ans:Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.)

4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?
Ans:The correct file extension for Python source code is '.py'.

5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?
Ans:Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. This means that the source code is executed line by line at
 runtime, rather than being translated into machine code and executed directly by the computer's hardware.

6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?
Ans:In Python, blocks of code are defined using indentation. There are a few common blocks of code used in Python, including:
1.Functions: defined using the def keyword
2.Classes: defined using the class keyword
3.Conditional statements: such as if, elif, and else
4.Loops: such as for and while
5.try-except blocks: for handling exceptions
These blocks are used to structure and organize code in a readable and maintainable manner.

7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?
Ans.a single-line comment can be added by starting the line with the hash symbol (#)
# This is a single-line comment in Python

8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?
Ans:  1.sys.version: This attribute returns a string that describes the version of the Python interpreter.
      2.sys.version_info: This attribute returns a named tuple that describes the version of the Python interpreter.
      3.platform.python_version(): This function returns a string that describes the version of the Python interpreter.

9.Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?
Ans:"lambda function"

10. What does pip stand for python?
Ans:"pip" stands for "Pip Installs Packages".

11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?
Ans: 
1.print(): Used to display output on the console
2.len(): Returns the length of a string, list, tuple, etc.
3.str(): Converts a value to a string
4.int(): Converts a value to an integer
5.float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number
6.range():Generates a sequence of numbers

12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?
Ans:In Python, there is no explicit limit on the length of an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.)

13. What are the benefits of using Python?
Ans.
1.Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to learn, 
even for those with no prior programming experience.
2.Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, 
scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more
3.Large and active community: Python has a large and active community of users and developers,
 who contribute to the language and its many libraries and tools. This means that help and support are always readily available.

4.Large standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules for many common programming tasks, 
such as connecting to web servers, reading and writing files, and working with data.

5.Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on many different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, 
without modification.

6.Dynamically typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you do not need to specify the type of a variable
 when declaring it. This makes it easier to write code quickly, as you don't need to worry about type-checking.

14. How is memory managed in Python?
Ans:memory management is handled automatically by the Python interpreter, using a memory manager and a garbage collector.

15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?
Ans: the steps to install Python on Windows and set the path variables:

1.Download the Python installer from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python on your system. It is recommended to add 
Python to the PATH during the installation process.

3.After installation, open the Command Prompt and type python to confirm that Python has been installed 
and the path has been set correctly.

To set the path variables, follow these steps:

.Open the Start menu and search for 'Environment Variables'
.Click on 'Edit the system environment variables'
.In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button
.Under 'System Variables', scroll down and find the 'Path' variable, then click on 'Edit'
.Add the path to the Python installation (e.g., C:\Python37\ or C:\Python37\Scripts\)
.Click 'OK' to close all windows and save the changes
.Verify that the path has been set correctly by opening a new Command Prompt and typing python again. You should now be able to run Python from any location on your system.

16. Is indentation required in python?
Ans.Yes, indentation is required in Python
