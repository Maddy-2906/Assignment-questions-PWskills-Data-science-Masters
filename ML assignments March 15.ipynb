    "#### Ans:-Supervised learning involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, where the input data and the desired output are both known. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that maps the input data to the output data, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features or classifying images into different categories.

The model is trained using algorithms such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n",

The model is trained using algorithms such as self-training, co-training, and multi-view learning.\n",
