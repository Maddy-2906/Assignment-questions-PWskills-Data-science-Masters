Assignment 2:

1. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following
criteria:
Marks
>90
>80
and <90
>=60
below 60
and <=80
Tax
15%

A
B
ะก
Ans.
percentage = float(input("Enter your percentage: "))

if percentage > 90:
    grade = "A"
    tax = 15
elif percentage >= 80:
    grade = "B"
    tax = 10
elif percentage >= 60:
    grade = "C"
    tax = 5
else:
    grade = "D"
    tax = 0

print("Grade:", grade)
print("Tax:", tax, "%")



2. Write a program to accept the cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the
following criteria:
City
Delhi
Agra
Jaipur
D
Cost Price (in Rs)
>100000
>50000 and <= 100000
<= 50000
Ans.
cost_price = float(input("Enter the cost price of the bike (in Rs): "))
city = input("Enter the city name: ")

if city.lower() == "delhi":
    if cost_price > 100000:
        tax = 5000
    elif cost_price > 50000:
        tax = 2500
    else:
        tax = 1000
else:
    tax = 0

print("Road tax:", tax, "Rs")


3. Accept any city from the user and display monuments of that city.
Monument
Red Fort
Taj Mahal
Jal Mahal

Ans:
city = input("Enter a city name: ")

if city.lower() == "delhi":
    print("Red Fort")
elif city.lower() == "agra":
    print("Taj Mahal")
elif city.lower() == "jaipur":
    print("Jal Mahal")
else:
    print("No monuments found for the given city.")


4. Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10.
Ans:
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

counter = 0
while number > 10:
    number = number / 3
    counter += 1

print("The number was divided by 3", counter, "times.")


5. Why and when to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example?
Ans.The while loop in Python is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. 
The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is True, and will exit when the condition becomes False.

an example to illustrate the use of a while loop:
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Iteration #", count)
    count += 1

6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern.
Ans.Pattern 1: Right Triangle
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print("*", end=" ")
        j += 1
    print("\n")
    i += 1

2.Pattern 2: Inverted Right Triangle
i = 5
while i >= 1:
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print("*", end=" ")
        j += 1
    print("\n")
    i -= 1
3.Pattern 3: Diamond Shape
n = 5
for i in range(1, n*2):
    for j in range(abs(n-i)):
        print(" ", end="")
    for j in range((i if i<=n else 2*n-i)*2-1):
        print("*", end="")
    print("")

7. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.
Ans.
num = 10

while num >= 1:
    print(num)
    num -= 1

8. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1
Ans.
num = 10

while num >= 1:
    print(num)
    num -= 1
