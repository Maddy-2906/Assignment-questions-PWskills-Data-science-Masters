    "#### Ans:-A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used for making inferences about a population based on sample data. The main difference between them is that a z-test assumes that the population standard deviation is known, or the sample size is large enough to estimate it accurately, while a t-test assumes that the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example scenario where you would use a t-test is when you want to compare the means of two small samples, such as comparing the exam scores of students in two different classes. In contrast, a z-test is appropriate when the sample size is large, and you want to test a hypothesis about the population mean, such as testing the effectiveness of a new drug on a large patient population."
