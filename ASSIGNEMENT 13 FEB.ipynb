    "#### Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-In Python, we use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception because it is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. It provides a standard structure and methods that all exceptions should have, such as a message that describes the exception, and methods to access that message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a custom exception that inherits from the Exception class allows us to define an exception that has the same properties and functionality as built-in exceptions. This means that the code that handles exceptions can treat our custom exception in the same way as built-in exceptions, making it easier to integrate and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, using the Exception class allows us to capture and handle our custom exception along with other built-in exceptions in a single try-except block, which simplifies the exception-handling logic in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall, by using the Exception class as the base class for our custom exception, we ensure that it follows the standard conventions for exception handling in Python, making it more maintainable and easier to work with in our codebase."

    "#### Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Exception handling is an important aspect of programming in Python. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Be specific with your exception handling: Instead of using a general try-except block, try to be specific and catch only the exceptions that you are expecting. This helps in identifying the root cause of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Use multiple except blocks: Use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately. This helps in handling each exception in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Provide informative error messages: Always provide informative error messages that explain what went wrong and why. This helps in debugging and fixing the issues quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Use finally block: Use the finally block to handle any clean-up operations that need to be performed after the try-except block has executed. For example, closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Don't catch all exceptions: Avoid catching all exceptions with a single except block as it can make debugging difficult. It is better to catch specific exceptions that are expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Handle exceptions close to the source: Handle exceptions as close to the source as possible. This helps in maintaining the flow of the program and identifying the root cause of the issue quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Use context managers: Use context managers such as \"with\" statement to automatically close files or release resources after use. This ensures that the resources are properly managed and the program doesn't run out of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Log the exceptions: Always log the exceptions in a file or database. This helps in identifying the frequency of the exceptions and finding patterns that can help in resolving the issue.\n",
