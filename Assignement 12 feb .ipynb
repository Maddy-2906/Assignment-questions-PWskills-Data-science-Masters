    "#What is an Exception in python? Write the difference  between Exceptions and syntax errors \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions can be raised for various reasons, such as an invalid operation, a missing file, or a value that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, the normal flow of control in the program is interrupted, and the interpreter jumps to the nearest exception handler. An exception handler is a block of code that is designed to handle a specific type of exception. If an exception is raised, and there is no matching exception handler, the program will terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters an error in the syntax of the program, and exceptions occur when an error occurs during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are usually easy to spot, because they occur when the program is being compiled. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis or forget to put a colon at the end of a line, you will get a syntax error. Syntax errors are usually the result of a typo or a mistake in the program's structure, and they prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, exceptions occur when the program is running, and they are usually more difficult to diagnose than syntax errors. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, you will get a ZeroDivisionError exception. Exceptions can be raised for many different reasons, and it's up to the programmer to handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the try and except statements to handle exceptions. The try statement is used to enclose the code that you want to test for exceptions. The except statement is used to specify the type of exception that you want to handle. If an exception is raised, the try statement will jump to the nearest except statement that matches the type of the exception, and the code in the except block will be executed.\n",

    "#Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-When an exception is not handled, it propagates up the call stack until it reaches the top level of the program. If the exception is not caught by any exception handler along the way, the program will terminate with a traceback, which is a list of the function calls that led up to the exception. The traceback can be useful for debugging the problem that caused the exception."
